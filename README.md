# DelouseR
Cleaner fish delousing studies

These scripts are for analysing and plotting data from tank delousing studies where ballan wrasse and lumpfish are cohabited with sea 
lice-infected Atlantic salmon. Novel object behaviour tests were also used to characterise the personality of individual cleaner fish.

Delousing-totals.R contains basic scripts for tidying and plotting time series lice data. 
Delousing-locations scripts are for plotting lice data on fish maps.

NOtrack.R tracks individual fish in a tank from extracted video frames.
NOanalysis.R contains scripts for calculating variables from behaviour data and correlating with delousing data.
